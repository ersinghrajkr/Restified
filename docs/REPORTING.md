# Comprehensive Reporting Integration

This document describes the comprehensive reporting capabilities integrated into the Restified framework.

## Overview

The Restified framework now includes enterprise-grade reporting capabilities with:

- **HTML Reports**: Beautiful, interactive Mochawesome reports with charts and code snippets
- **JSON Reports**: Machine-readable reports for CI/CD integration
- **Execution Summaries**: Comprehensive test execution metadata and statistics
- **Global Setup Integration**: Automatic report infrastructure setup and cleanup
- **Multi-Format Output**: Support for various report formats and consolidation

## Report Types Generated

### 1. HTML Reports (Mochawesome)
- **Location**: `reports/{category}/{filename}.html`
- **Features**: Interactive charts, code snippets, request/response data
- **Categories**: examples, basic, auth, advanced, tests

### 2. JSON Reports
- **Location**: `reports/{category}/{filename}.json`
- **Purpose**: CI/CD integration, programmatic analysis
- **Structure**: Standard Mochawesome JSON format

### 3. Execution Reports
- **execution-summary.json**: Comprehensive test execution metadata
- **execution-report.md**: Human-readable execution summary
- **execution-metadata.json**: Test run configuration and setup info

### 4. CI/CD Integration Reports
- **ci-cd-summary.json**: Summary for continuous integration
- **ci-summary.md**: GitHub Actions compatible summary
- **comprehensive-report.html**: Merged report from all test runs

## Available NPM Scripts

### Individual Test Reports
```bash
# Generate reports for specific test categories
npm run examples:report          # All examples with HTML report
npm run examples:basic:report    # Basic examples only
npm run examples:auth:report     # Authentication examples only
npm run examples:advanced:report # Advanced examples only
npm run test:report             # Unit and integration tests
```

### Comprehensive Reporting
```bash
# Generate comprehensive reports for all test types
npm run reports:comprehensive   # Run all tests and generate merged reports
npm run test:comprehensive     # Tests + examples with reports
```

### Report Management
```bash
# Merge and generate reports from existing JSON files
npm run reports:merge          # Merge all JSON reports
npm run reports:generate       # Generate HTML from merged JSON
npm run reports:clean          # Clean reports directory
```

## Report Directory Structure

├── execution-report.md      # Human-readable execution summary
└── execution-metadata.json # Test run configuration
```

## Global Setup Integration

The reporting infrastructure is automatically configured in the global setup:

### Automatic Setup Features
- **Directory Creation**: Automatic creation of report directory structure
- **Metadata Generation**: Test execution metadata and configuration capture
- **Environment Info**: Node.js version, platform, architecture capture
- **Variable Tracking**: Global, local, and extracted variable documentation
- **Authentication Status**: Auth token and user information (redacted in reports)

### Enhanced Teardown Features
- **Execution Statistics**: Total duration, test counts, environment info
- **Comprehensive Cleanup**: Resource cleanup with final statistics
- **Report Generation**: Automatic execution summary and readable report creation

## Configuration Integration

### Client Configuration Documentation
All HTTP client configurations are automatically documented:

```json
{
  "clients": {
    "api": {
      "baseURL": "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com",
      "timeout": 10000,
      "status": "configured"
    },
    "testUtils": {
      "baseURL": "https://httpbin.org", 
      "timeout": 15000,
      "status": "configured"
    },
    "auth": {
      "baseURL": "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com",
      "timeout": 5000,
      "status": "configured"
    }
  }
}
```

### Global Headers Documentation
Common headers applied to all requests:

```json
{
  "globalHeaders": {
    "X-Test-Suite": "restified-examples",
    "X-Environment": "development",
    "X-API-Version": "v1",
    "X-Example-Mode": "true",
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Accept": "application/json"
  }
}
```

## Mochawesome Configuration

### Report Options
- **Charts**: Interactive test execution charts
- **Code**: Source code snippets in reports
- **Request/Response Data**: HTTP request and response details
- **Overwrite**: Fresh reports for each run
- **Assets**: Embedded fonts and styles for offline viewing

### Custom Context Integration
The `GlobalTestUtils` provides methods for adding context to reports:

```typescript
// Add custom context to test reports
GlobalTestUtils.addToTestContext(this, {
  environment: GlobalTestUtils.getEnvironmentInfo(),
  testContext: GlobalTestUtils.captureTestContext('SuiteName', 'TestName')
});
```

## CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions Integration
The generated `ci-summary.md` is compatible with GitHub Actions job summaries:

```yaml
- name: Generate Test Reports
  run: npm run reports:comprehensive
  
- name: Upload Reports
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
  with:
    name: test-reports
    path: reports/
```

### Jenkins Integration
JSON reports can be consumed by Jenkins for build statistics and trend analysis.

### Azure DevOps Integration
The comprehensive HTML reports can be published as build artifacts.

## Enterprise Features

### Security Considerations
- **Token Redaction**: Authentication tokens are automatically redacted in reports
- **Environment Variable Filtering**: Sensitive environment variables are not exposed
- **Configurable Information**: Control what information is included in reports

### Performance Metrics
- **Execution Duration**: Total test execution time tracking
- **Suite Performance**: Individual test suite execution metrics
- **Client Performance**: HTTP client timeout and response time documentation

### Audit Trail
- **Execution ID**: Unique identifier for each test run
- **Timestamp Tracking**: Start and end time documentation
- **Environment Documentation**: Complete environment and configuration capture

## Viewing Reports

### HTML Reports
Open any `.html` file in the reports directory with a web browser for interactive viewing.

### Comprehensive Report
After running `npm run reports:comprehensive`, open:
```
reports/final/comprehensive-report.html
```

### CI/CD Integration
Check the following files for programmatic integration:
- `reports/final/ci-cd-summary.json`
- `reports/final/ci-summary.md`
- `reports/execution-summary.json`

## Best Practices

### Regular Report Generation
- Generate reports after significant test changes
- Use comprehensive reports for release documentation
- Archive reports for historical analysis

### CI/CD Integration
- Always generate reports in CI/CD pipelines
- Upload reports as build artifacts
- Use JSON reports for automated analysis

### Report Maintenance
- Clean old reports regularly with `npm run reports:clean`
- Archive comprehensive reports for major releases
- Monitor report generation performance

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Missing Reports**: Ensure all dependencies are installed (`npm install`)
2. **Permission Errors**: Check write permissions for reports directory
3. **Merge Failures**: Verify JSON reports are valid before merging

### Debug Information
Enable verbose logging by setting:
```bash
DEBUG=mochawesome* npm run examples:report
```
