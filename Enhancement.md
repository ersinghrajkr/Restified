ðŸš€ Next Enhancement Roadmap

  Based on the deep analysis we did, here are the high-impact improvements we should implement next:

  Phase 1: Reliability & Resilience

1. Smart Retry System - Exponential backoff with jitter
2. Circuit Breaker Pattern - Auto-disable failing endpoints
3. Request Timeout Intelligence - Context-aware timeouts
4. Error Recovery - Graceful degradation strategies

  Phase 2: Advanced Performance

1. Request Deduplication - Avoid duplicate calls
2. Response Caching - Smart caching with TTL
3. Request Batching - Combine multiple calls
4. Streaming Support - Handle large datasets efficiently

  Phase 3: Enterprise Monitoring

1. Health Checks - Endpoint monitoring
2. Metrics Collection - Performance tracking
3. Request/Response Validation Pipeline - Pre-flight checks
4. Memory Management - Efficient object pooling
